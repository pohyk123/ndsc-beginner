# Product Category Classification
## Competition Summary
In this year's Beginner Category of National Data Science Challenge (NDSC), participants are required to determine the category of a product given its image and title. For more details of the competition, visit the [Kaggle] page.

## Proposed Solution
Using an architecture incorporating parallel networks, the model learns from both text and image data simultaneously, hence predicting new items with greater accuracy.
